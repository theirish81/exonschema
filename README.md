# ExonSchema (EXtract jsON Schema)
## Abstract
ExonSchema is a Java library that will generate JSON Schemas, based on a sample JSON payload.

### ExonWalker
The core functionality that takes a JSON payload and generates a JsonSchema for it.
In the case of inconsistent data structures (such as arrays with different objects), it will
generate different scenarios for each detected data disposition.
The generated schema must be able to validate the provided JSON or any JSON that is structurally
equivalent.

### ExonSimplifier
Given a Schema generated by ExonWalker, this class will try to simplify the Schema, searching for
similarities between scenarios and merging them, given a certain similarity coefficient. While
this is not necessary for validation purposes, it may help you to create more reasonable and faster
schemas.

### Notes
* Yes, I'm very bad at naming things;
* The first release is not yet finalized, but you're very welcome to try it out.
